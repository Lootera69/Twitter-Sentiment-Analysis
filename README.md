# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes the Twitter API for sentiment analysis on tweets related to a specific topic. By applying natural language processing (NLP) through the TextBlob library, the script determines the sentiment polarity of each tweet.

## Prerequisites
- Twitter Developer account with API keys and access tokens.
- Python installed, along with required libraries: tweepy, matplotlib, and textblob.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lootera69/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
```
Open the script and replace placeholder values for Twitter API credentials.

Run the script:
```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```
##How It Works
The script fetches tweets related to a specified topic (e.g., 'NLP') using the Twitter API. It then employs sentiment analysis with TextBlob to determine whether each tweet carries a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. The results are presented visually through a pie chart, offering a clear depiction of the sentiment distribution within the collected tweets.

##Results and Insights
Embark on a journey to gain comprehensive insights into the sentiment landscape surrounding your chosen topic. Uncover the pulse of public opinion and discover prevailing emotions within the Twitter community. The pie chart visually represents the sentiment breakdown, allowing for a quick and intuitive understanding of the overall sentiment trend.
