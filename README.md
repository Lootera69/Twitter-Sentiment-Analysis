## Sentiment Analysis with NLP on Twitter Data

### Description

This project involves a Sentiment Analysis system that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Twitter data. It connects to the Twitter API through Tweepy, retrieves tweets related to a specific topic (e.g., "India"), and applies NLP sentiment analysis using TextBlob.

Using the TextBlob library, the project performs sentiment analysis on the collected Twitter data. Tweets are categorized into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments based on their polarity. The results are presented through a pie chart, illustrating the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets related to the chosen topic.

### Technology Stack
